# PolicyRenewals (work in progress)

Data preparation, EDA and modeling on an imbalanced dataset from:
https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/imbalanced-data-practice?select=aug_train.csv 

In this exercise:
I further improve my data wrangling skills with dplyr,
Perform automatic feature engineering,
Work with SMOTE and ROSE methods for upsampling and PCA,
Fit, evaluate and compare caret models,
Create more advanced ggplot2 graphics for EDA, 
Play around with tidyquant (excel-like functions, e.g. pivot tables),
Study explainable AI (XAI) methods with DALEX,


Despite the repository name, we _build a model to predict whether the policyholders (Health Insurance) from past year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company._ [Kaggle]


Comments:
Overall, this exercise would be more interesting, if there were more information on the variables, e.g. the regions, or
the sales channels. In that case, some well informed and justified feature engineering could be performed. A similar point
could be made when it comes to visual presentation.
